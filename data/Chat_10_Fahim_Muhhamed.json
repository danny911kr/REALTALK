For example if someone were to write a Uncharted prose style book I don't think it would be very good, at least as an adaptation because it wouldn't capture the same vibe as the original Source material. This is in contrast with for example God of War which I think would turn into a rather good prose style book because sure there's action in God of War at least the later ones the tone is also very solemn and the scenery is beautiful it's also fantasy which I think lends itself rather naturally to prose style writing.",

The combat is great, it feels fast and Powerful without being over the top. and the combo system encourages you to experiment and see how high you can get it which is really enjoyable it reminds me of the Spider-Man PS4 combat which was in turn  inspired by the Arkham games",

I watched the MCU Spider-Man movies and I watched Toy Story 4. Toy Story 4 is a great movie even if it is just about family or trying to escape from  the monotony of everyday life. The movie is made for kids but it's still held my attention all the way through and that is hard to do. The movie has to be quite good to balance being for children and being like a good movie. That reminds me of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  mutant Madness. I watched it in theaters and for once all of the voice actors were actually teens and they acted like teens. unlike the 2003 show where you have a hard time believing that their teens. Although one of the main points against the movie is how simplistic the plot is, I think that it does a great job of establishing the turtles and it sets up for a sequel very well. if you haven't seen it you should watch it",
