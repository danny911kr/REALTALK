It's unfortunate that people who aren't involved in the creative process can influence when a game comes out. Like the share holders and board members shouldn't decide when a game is fully out just to make some money for themselves. The first release left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and pushed them away from buying more of that company's games in the future. If they make another game connected to this one in the future and have it be a solid and complete game on release then I'll definitely buy it but I'm not really holding out much hope for something like that to happen.
