Another place I really like is called Level 6 Rooftop. It’s a rooftop club-restaurant six floors up from Amal in Coconut Grove sticks to its Spanish theme for a weekend brunch. There’s Spanish brioche french toast with ricotta cheese and strawberries, and an eggs benedict with manchego biscuit and chorizo.

The mastermind, known as 'The Professor', assembles a group of skilled individuals to carry out an ambitious plan to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. What's fascinating about the show is not just the heist itself, but the depth of the characters involved. Each of them has a distinct personality and backstory, which adds layers of complexity to the narrative. The show does an excellent job of blending action, psychological drama, and a bit of romance, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I'm really intrigued to see how the characters' relationships develop and how they handle the challenges thrown their way. It's no wonder 'Casa de Papel' has become such a global sensation!

Also, at times, it felt like they were undecided whether they wanted this to be a comedy or a drama.\nThe premise of their \"lawyering\" is basically \"hey you owe me this, do this for me\" and around the circle the same every time. And someone always had an ace in their sleeve, but they kept it for way too long, just use it and be done with it. How were they actually solving any of the cases while there was so much internal drama going around... Real law was bent so hard to fit the show, but I don't mind that part, it didn't take away from the story, they made it believable. There were no lawyer's deaths or judge's, which happen way more often in real life, that would have made the show more realistic. Mike going to prison made me interested in the show once again, I liked that season the most probably.

With your new blonde hair, using a purple shampoo like Clairol Shimmer Lights is a great choice to keep any brassiness at bay.\nAs a blonde, here are a few extra tips for your hair care routine:\n- Look for products specifically formulated for blonde or color-treated hair. They help maintain your color and prevent fading.\n- Avoid harsh chemicals like sulfates and parabens, as they can strip color and dry out your hair.\n- Consider using a toner or a gloss treatment periodically to maintain the desired shade of blonde.\n- Be extra careful with heat styling. Use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.\n- Protect your hair from the sun as UV rays can alter the color and dry out your hair.\nRemember, the key is to keep your hair nourished and moisturized.",

It's great that you're looking into keratin-infused products as keratin helps strengthen and repair hair, especially with heat styling. For specific product recommendations, I suggest looking for reputable brands that specialize in hair care, as they often have well-researched formulas. Checking reviews, especially from people with similar hair types, can also be helpful.\nThe frequency of using keratin products depends on your hair type and condition. If you have damaged or color-treated hair, you might benefit from more frequent use. However, for normal hair, using a keratin heat protectant each time you apply heat can be sufficient. It's important to maintain a balance, as too much keratin can make hair stiff and brittle. If you notice your hair feeling hard or less elastic, it might be good to reduce the frequency. Consider alternating between keratin and non-keratin heat protectants to maintain balance.",

Also, this is great for your hair to make it shiny and silky.\nIf you wear makeup, WASH IT OFF EVERY NIGHT. No exceptions to this one.\nInstead of lotion, I use liquid coconut oil to moisturize after a shower. It has helped my KP more than any dermatologist, keeps it silky smooth and touchable, moisturizes like mad, and leaves a light sweet scent. If you can't find coconut oil, look for tubs of Eucerin. It is sent from the skin gods, though expensive.\nFor a face scrub since I have dry skin, I mix raw sugar with coconut oil and a bit of honey. Rinse and pat dry with a clean towel. I don't know if I'd suggest this for someone with oily skin, though.\nSomething a lot of people don't do because of the extra time it takes is PAT DRY with a dry towel after you step out of the shower. Rubbing can scrape your skin in ways it shouldn't be. Within 3 minutes of patting dry, apply moisturizer all over. The moisturizer locks in the water on the outer layers of your skin; it doesn't normally put more in. After about three minutes, all that good ole' H2O evaporates.",

I think the amount of sessions varies depending on the office you go to and the area where you’re getting lasered, but I only did 5 sessions I think?
