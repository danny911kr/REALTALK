The next thing they universally say? ‚ÄúWhat about coconut oil?!‚Äù UGH. Coconut oil gets on my nerves. Yes, it‚Äôs colorless, smells great, and is so damn trendy you feel like you fit in just by using it. But when it became a huge deal several years ago, I decided to give it a go‚Ä¶ And I hated the results. My hair felt stiff and sticky, not at all soft like how my olive oil masks turn out. So ever since I‚Äôve been on a crusade against it. If you want my step-by-step olive oil mask routine, PM me and I‚Äôll copy/paste it from my notes.\nOlaplex. I was the BIGGEST skeptic of Olaplex. I didn‚Äôt even try it until January of 2018 when I had gotten a shadow root, hated it, and my stylist (love her so much) had to do some crazy stuff to bleach it out. She convinced me to try Olaplex and my hair LOVED it! It‚Äôs the best thing to happen to blondes since toner. Imagine the bleaching process is a home invasion robber who kicks your hair‚Äôs front door in. Olaplex comes along, shuts the door, and sweeps the porch. I‚Äôm very against the term ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù product; it‚Äôs not magic. It‚Äôs technology called a bond builder, which repairs the broken bonds from bleaching, coloring, heat, etc. It instantly makes the hair stronger, softer, and smoother. Don‚Äôt overdo it‚Äîonce or twice a month is fine. Olaplex No. 3 is the take home version that you‚Äôd use. Apply to damp hair, let it sit for 20-30 minutes, then shampoo and condition afterwards (very important).",

Involves a quick marinating of the sliced chicken in bit of bicarbonate soda for about 20mins and rinsing it off. It really tenderises it and adds an takeout-authenticity to it.\nA splash of red wine always brings my bolognese and other pasta sauces up a notch and creates a depth of flavour when they're lacking\nFor savory dishes a little anchovy paste goes along ways to add a secret sauce taste.\nI use a garlic and onion seasoning from gourmet collections that makes bland dishes very flavorful when I don‚Äôt feel up to doing something more complex.",

You will gain leg muscle if you go regularly, but it'll only be significant if you go many times a week for a long time and push it hard. My suggestion is Spin a couple/few times a week and a weight program, as well. Sometimes gyms offer a group weights-style program (like a \"bootcamp\" or \"circuit training\" sort of deal). Spinning will improve your cardio conditioning. If you combine it with eating less, you'll lose fat, but not as efficiently as if you also add in weight training. But I want to reiterate: I love spin class. haha. Definitely give it a try!

I've never been more chilled in my life as during and after these trips. 11/10 would recommend",

Man-made beach, though pretty nice.\nTwo types of islands in the Maldives: Local and Resort. Local islands alcohol is forbidden. Resort islands anything goes.\nIf you book with resorts directly, they usually handle the transfers and such from Male.\nInclusive packages at resort usually offer buffet food that is \"meh# at best. Remember, everything imported. On one of my work trips, stayed at one to inspect their boats, meals included in the rate, but not drinks. I am a Diet Coke drinker, my colleague was French, meaning he could easily down 8 or 10 espressos per day. Combined, we spend about USD 500 over 3 days just soda and coffee. In other words, most resorts the food is optional, but you have no other outlets but the resort (you are on an island), so enough 50 dollar burgers can add up quickly.\nIsland hopping is possible, but gets extremely expensive.(except the local MDTC slow ferries... those are cheap, uncomfortable, and very slow with limited destinations.",
