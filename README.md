## 🔁 Continuation of LoCoMo

REALTALK builds upon our previous work **LoCoMo**, a synthetic dataset generated by LLMs for simulating long-term dialogue. 
While LoCoMo provided a controlled sandbox for exploring memory and persona behavior, **REALTALK offers real-world complexity**, drawn from human conversations across 21 days.

## 📚 Overview

Long-term, open-domain dialogue is critical for building conversational agents capable of demonstrating **emotional intelligence (EI)** and **recalling past interactions**. However, most existing benchmarks rely on synthetic, LLM-generated data, which lacks the depth, messiness, and variability of real conversations.

To address this gap, we introduce **REALTALK**: a 21-day corpus of **authentic, real-world messaging app conversations** between human participants. This enables a more rigorous evaluation of dialogue models in naturalistic settings.

### 🧠 Key Contributions
- A **real-world long-form dialogue dataset** with emotional grounding and time-span variation.
- Comparative analysis of **emotional expression** and **persona consistency** between REALTALK and LLM-generated dialogues (LoCoMo).
- Two benchmark tasks designed for long-term conversation evaluation:
  1. **Persona Simulation** – continue a chat as a specific user based on past messages.
  2. **Memory Probing** – answer questions that require recalling facts from earlier interactions.

## ⚙️ Setup

Set your OpenAI API key for memory probing tasks:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## 📦 Data

- `data/*.json`: Preprocessed REALTALK conversations (for evaluation and model input).
- `data/raw/*.xlsx`: Raw message exports used to construct the dataset.

## 🧪 Tasks

### 🗣️ Persona Simulation (Coming soon)

> Given previous conversation history, continue the dialogue as one of the original participants.  
Code and model evaluation details will be released shortly.

---

### 🧠 Memory Probing

> Assess how well a model remembers facts from earlier parts of a long conversation.

#### 🔧 Run evaluation:
```bash
python evaluate_memory.py \
    --data_path data/Chat_1_Emi_Elise.json \
    --qa_model gpt-4o-mini \
    --evaluate_model gpt-4o-mini
```

#### 📝 Argument details:
- `--qa_model`: The model used to generate answers to the probing questions.
- `--evaluate_model`: The model used to assign a **GPT score**.  
  A **lexical F1 score** is also computed as a rule-based measure.
